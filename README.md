The first functioning code I've ever made!

It's a tiny console game, where the player will have to think of a number. The console will then print a number, and the player will have to tell the game if the
correct number is lower or higher (by using the arrow keys) then the game's guess. Depending on the players input, the game will automatically adjust the 'min' and
'max' values, add them together and divide them by two, until hitting the correct number. By hitting 'Return' the player will tell the game that it guessed the
correct number, and the game will then restart.
